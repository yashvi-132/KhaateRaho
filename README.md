# KhaateRaho
Khaate-Raaho is a JavaScript application that interacts with the food2fork API to fetch and display recipe data. Khaate-Raaho allows users to look up recipes and compile their own cookbook. Users can not only search up recipes, but also adjust them for the amount of servings, save them as favourites and a generate a shopping list from the ingredients.
Technologies Used: 
1.HTML5 & CSS3 The layout was carefully designed using CSS3 BEM naming convention. CSS-Grid was used to comply with the newest standards of development. 
2.JavaScript No frameworks were used in the development of this application. All functionality was built with vanilla ES6 JavaScript so feel free to dive into the code. 
3.Webpack was used as the module bundler to incorporate Axios for fetching as well as BABEL for compiling the next-gen JavaScript.
